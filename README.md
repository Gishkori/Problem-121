# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

This repository contains the solution to **LeetCode Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**. The problem requires finding the maximum profit that can be made by buying a stock on one day and selling it on another day in the future.

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the **maximum profit** you can achieve from this transaction. If no profit can be made, return `0`.

### Example 1:

- **Input**: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- **Output**: `5`
- **Explanation**: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = `6 - 1 = 5`.

### Example 2:

- **Input**: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
- **Output**: `0`
- **Explanation**: In this case, no transactions are possible, so the maximum profit is `0`.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
